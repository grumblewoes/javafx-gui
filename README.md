All about playing around with JavaFX to learn more about GUI development


HelloFX focuses on just getting the stage and scene to display, along with simple stuff to add to the scene graph (text, lines, shapes, etc).

GUITest (so far) focuses on adding action events to components and learning how to operate Scene Builder to help construct the fxml file.
